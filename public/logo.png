# This is a placeholder for the logo.png file
# You'll need to replace this with your actual logo image file.
# 
# To add your logo:
# 1. Save your logo image as "logo.png" in the public folder
# 2. Make sure it's a square image (preferably 100x100px or larger)
# 3. PNG format with transparent background works best
#
# The logo will automatically appear in the header next to the title.
